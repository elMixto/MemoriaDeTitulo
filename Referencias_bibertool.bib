  ABSTRACT = {On the 30th anniversary of a meeting between engineers and economists at Princeton University to discuss the potential application of stochastic control methods to economics, this paper provides a review of past, present and paths ahead. The events surrounding some of the key developments of the past are described along with a discussion of the present state of the research and of paths for future research. The paper is structured around the primary methods for solving quadratic-linear economic stochastic control models, namely open loop, classical control, handcrafted feedback rules, optimal feedback, min–max control, optimal feedback rules with parameter uncertainty and dual control. The paper also includes a discussion of software developments in economic stochastic control modeling.},

@ARTICLE{ros-roca_notes_2017,
  ABSTRACT = {Mathematical and simulation models of systems lay at the core of many decision support systems, and their role becomes more critical when the system is more complex. The decision process usually involves optimizing some utility function that evaluates the performance indicators measuring the impacts of the decisions. The complexity of the system directly increases the difficulty when the associated function to be optimized is a non-analytical, non-differentiable, non-linear function that can only be evaluated by simulation. Simulation-optimization techniques are especially suited to these cases, and its use is becoming increasingly used with traffic models, which represent an archetypal case of complex, dynamic systems that exhibit highly stochastic characteristics. In this approach, simulation is used to evaluate the objective function, and it is combined with a non-differentiable optimization technique for solving the associated optimization problem. Of these techniques, one of the most commonly used is Stochastic Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA). This paper analyses, discusses and presents the computational results from applying this technique in the calibration of traffic simulation models. This study uses variants of the SPSA by replacing the usual gradient approach with a combination of projected gradient and trust region methods. A special approach has also been analyzed for parameter calibration cases in which each variable has a different magnitude.},

  ABSTRACT = {The plasma control system (PCS) is a key part in tokamak operations, which requires test and verification. Dynamic system simulation tools have been widely utilized to build a simulation environment to verify the design of plasma control systems as well as other parts of tokamak systems under various operation scenarios, save the time and cost of real discharges, improve the efficiency of deployment and reduce risks. To provide a simulation platform based on open-source software as part of the infrastructure of the PCS-VP (Verification Platform) of the China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR), a framework named DSSim (Dynamic System Simulation) is proposed. It is an environment for dynamic system simulation based on Python, which enables users to build and simulate hierarchical block diagram models with interconnected systems that corresponds to different dynamic systems. Solutions for special tasks that helps improve the accuracy of simulation like flattening the model hierarchy, scheduling system execution order and solving continuous systems are implemented and will be automatically invoked in different phases of simulation. A GUI client with the DSSim framework built in is developed to allow for constructing and simulating block diagram models in a more user-friendly way. A model of the vacuum field system of the Experimental and Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) is built and simulated with DSSim and the result is compared with that of the same model in MATLAB/Simulink to test the framework's precision and usability.},

  ABSTRACT = {It is indispensable to make full use of parallel and distributed systems with increasing demands for large-scale traffic simulation, but problems remain about insufficient scalability due to costs of synchronization by load unbalancing among compute nodes. To tackle this problem, we propose performance optimization method for traffic simulations to underlying road networks preprocessed by graph contraction introducing dynamic re-assignment vehicles and cross points to threads and nodes based on time-series traffic congestion. By applying the optimization and running the simulation of the real-world Dublin city on 16 compute nodes of TSUBAME 2.5, the simulation performance has improved by 4 times with the proposed graph contraction method. We compared the effect of optimizations between the agent assignment method and existing adaptive synchronization method with comparison to regular 1 synchronization per step.},

  ABSTRACT = {Background Elderly population has been progressively rising in the world, thus the demand for anti-aging heath products to assure longevity as well as to ameliorate age-related complications is also on the rise. Among various anti-aging health products, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) has been gaining attentions of the consumers and the scientific community. Aim of review This article intends to provide an overview on the current knowledge on promises and safety concerns of NMN as an anti-aging health product. Key scientific concepts of review Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels in the body deplete with aging and it is associated with downregulation of energy production in mitochondria, oxidative stress, DNA damage, cognitive impairment and inflammatory conditions. However, NMN, as the precursor of NAD+, can slow down this process by elevating NAD+ levels in the body. A number of in vivo studies have indicated affirmative results of therapeutic effects for various age-induced complications with NMN supplementation. One preclinical and one clinical study have been conducted to investigate the safety concerns of NMN administration while a few more human clinical trials are being conducted. As there is a large influx of NMN based anti-aging products on the market, proper clinical investigations are urgently needed to find out the effectiveness and safety of NMN supplementation.},

Due to its simple structure and challenging difficulty it has been studied intensively during the last two decades. The present paper gives a survey of upper bounds presented in the literature, and show the relative tightness of several of the bounds. Techniques for deriving the bounds include relaxation from upper planes, linearization, reformulation, Lagrangian relaxation, Lagrangian decomposition, and semidefinite programming. A short overview of heuristics, reduction techniques, branch-and-bound algorithms and approximation results is given, followed by an overview of valid inequalities for the quadratic knapsack polytope. The paper is concluded by an experimental study where the upper bounds presented are compared with respect to strength and computational effort.},

  ABSTRACT = {Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is recognized as a unifying framework for modeling a wide range of problems. Problems can be solved with commercial solvers customized for solving QUBO and since QUBO have degree two, it is useful to have a method for transforming higher degree pseudo-Boolean problems to QUBO format. The standard transformation approach requires additional auxiliary variables supported by penalty terms for each higher degree term. This paper improves on the existing cubic-to-quadratic transformation approach by minimizing the number of additional variables as well as penalty coefficient. Extensive experimental testing on Max 3-SAT modeled as QUBO shows a near 100\% reduction in the subproblem size used for minimization of the number of auxiliary variables.},

We investigate several basic semidefinite relaxations of this problem and compare their strength in theory and in practice.

The cutting planes either arise from quadratic representations of linear inequalities or from linear inequalities in the quadratic model. In particular, a large family of combinatorial cuts is introduced for the linear formulation of the knapsack problem in quadratic space. Computational results on a small class of practical problems illustrate the quality of these relaxations and cutting planes.},

  ABSTRACT = {The 0-1 cubic knapsack problem (CKP), a generalization of the classical 0-1 quadratic knapsack problem, is an extremely challenging NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. An effective exact solution strategy for the CKP is to reformulate the nonlinear problem into an equivalent linear form that can then be solved using a standard mixed-integer programming solver. We consider a classical linearization method and propose a variant of a more recent technique for linearizing 0-1 cubic programs applied to the CKP. Using a variable reordering strategy, we show how to improve the strength of the linear programming relaxation of our proposed reformulation, which ultimately leads to reduced overall solution times. In addition, we develop a simple heuristic method for obtaining good-quality CKP solutions that can be used to provide a warm start to the solver. Computational tests demonstrate the effectiveness of both our variable reordering strategy and heuristic method.},

It generalises the Robust Knapsack formulation to encompass possible relations between subsets of items having every possible cardinality. This allows to better describe the utility function for the decision maker, at the price of increasing the complexity of the problem. Thus, in order to solve realistic instances in a reasonable amount of time, two heuristics are proposed. The first one applies machine learning techniques in order to quickly select the majority of the items, while the second makes use of genetic algorithms to solve the problem. A set of simulation examples is finally presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

  ABSTRACT = {Spanning tree problems with specialized constraints can be difficult to solve in real-world scenarios, often requiring intricate algorithmic design and exponential time. Recently, there has been growing interest in end-to-end deep neural networks for solving routing problems. However, such methods typically produce sequences of vertices, which makes it difficult to apply them to general combinatorial optimization problems where the solution set consists of edges, as in various spanning tree problems. In this paper, we propose NeuroPrim, a novel framework for solving various spanning tree problems by defining a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for general combinatorial optimization problems on graphs. Our approach reduces the action and state space using Prim's algorithm and trains the resulting model using REINFORCE. We apply our framework to three difficult problems on Euclidean space: the Degree-constrained Minimum Spanning Tree (DCMST) problem, the Minimum Routing Cost Spanning Tree (MRCST) problem, and the Steiner Tree Problem in graphs (STP). Experimental results on literature instances demonstrate that our model outperforms strong heuristics and achieves small optimality gaps of up to 250 vertices. Additionally, we find that our model has strong generalization ability, with no significant degradation observed on problem instances as large as 1000. Our results suggest that our framework can be effective for solving a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems beyond spanning tree problems.},

Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.},

  ABSTRACT = {0-1 knapsack is of fundamental importance across many fields. In this paper, we present a game-theoretic method to solve 0-1 knapsack problems (KPs) where the number of items (products) is large and the values of items are not predetermined but decided by an external value assignment function (e.g., a neural network in our case) during the optimization process. While existing papers are interested in predicting solutions with neural networks for classical KPs whose objective functions are mostly linear functions, we are interested in solving KPs whose objective functions are neural networks. In other words, we choose a subset of items that maximize the sum of the values predicted by neural networks. Its key challenge is how to optimize the neural network-based non-linear KP objective with a budget constraint. Our solution is inspired by game-theoretic approaches in deep learning, e.g., generative adversarial networks. After formally defining our two-player game, we develop an adaptive gradient ascent method to solve it. In our experiments, our method successfully solves two neural network-based non-linear KPs and conventional linear KPs with 1 million items.},

  ABSTRACT = {Machine Learning (ML) has gained much importance in recent years as many of its effective applications are involved in different fields, healthcare, banking, trading, gaming, etc. Similarly, Combinatorial Optimisation (CO) keeps challenging researchers by new problems with more complex constraints. Merging both fields opens new horizons for development in many areas. This study investigates how effective is to solve CO problems by ML methods. The work considers the Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) as a study case, which is an np-hard CO problem well-known for its multiple applications. The proposed approach suggests to use solutions of small-size MKP to build models with different ML methods; then, to apply the obtained models on large-size MKP to predict their solutions. The features consist of scores calculated based on information about items while the labels consist of decision variables of optimal solutions calculated from applying CPLEX Solver on small-size MKP. Supervised ML methods build models that help to predict structures of large-size MKP solutions and build them accordingly. A comparison of five ML methods is conducted on standard data set. The experiments showed that the tested methods were able to reach encouraging results. In addition, the study proposes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that exploits ML outputs essentially in initialisation operator and to repair unfeasible solutions. The algorithm denoted GaPR explores the ML solution neighbourhood as a way of intensification to approach optimal solutions. The carried out experiments indicated that the approach was effective and competitive.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach for solving knapsack problem. The proposed method consists of a state aggregation step based on tabular reinforcement learning to extract features and construct states. The state aggregation policy is applied to each problem instance of the knapsack problem, which is used with Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) algorithm to train a policy through which the items are sequentially selected at each time step. The method is a constructive solution approach and the process of selecting items is repeated until the final solution is obtained. The experiments show that our approach provides close to optimal solutions for all tested instances, outperforms the greedy algorithm, and is able to handle larger instances and more flexible than an existing DRL approach. In addition, the results demonstrate that the proposed model with the state aggregation strategy not only gives better solutions but also learns in less timesteps, than the one without state aggregation.},

  ABSTRACT = {The budget problem of selecting projects (or activities) with known values (or payoffs) and associated costs, subject to a prescribed maximum budget, is akin to the knapsack problem, which is well documented in the literature. The optimal solution to maximise the total value of selected projects for a given budget constraint can readily be obtained. In practice, budgets are often somewhat flexible, or subject to possible changes, so that an optimal solution for a given budget value may not remain optimal when the budget is modified. It is, therefore, sensible in many situations to consider a budget range, instead of a single budget value. In addition to their original objective of maximising the total value of selected projects, decision makers are often concerned to get ‘value for money’, indicated by the ratio of payoff to cost. This paper examines how these questions can be tackled through the introduction of a stability index, to guide project selection within a defined budget range, and the use of a portfolio diagram, to help in the ranking of projects with respect to the stated twin objectives.},

  ABSTRACT = {The classical maximum flow problem sometimes occurs in settings in which the arc capacities are not fixed but are functions of a single parameter, and the goal is to find the value of the parameter such that the corresponding maximum flow or minimum cut satisfies some side condition. Finding the desired parameter value requires solving a sequence of related maximum flow problems. In this paper it is shown that the recent maximum flow algorithm of Goldberg and Tarjan can be extended to solve an important class of such parametric maximum flow problems, at the cost of only a constant factor in its worst-case time bound. Faster algorithms for a variety of combinatorial optimization problems follow from the result.},

@ARTICLE{mohammadi_triangular_2017,
  ABSTRACT = {Network alignment has extensive applications in comparative interactomics. Traditional approaches aim to simultaneously maximize the number of conserved edges and the underlying similarity of aligned entities. We propose a novel formulation of the network alignment problem that extends topological similarity to higher-order structures and provides a new objective function that maximizes the number of aligned substructures. This objective function corresponds to an integer programming problem, which is NP-hard. Consequently, we identify a closely related surrogate function whose maximization results in a tensor eigenvector problem. Based on this formulation, we present an algorithm called Triangular AlignMEnt (TAME), which attempts to maximize the number of aligned triangles across networks. Using a case study on the NAPAbench dataset, we show that triangular alignment is capable of producing mappings with high node correctness. We further evaluate our method by aligning yeast and human interactomes. Our results indicate that TAME outperforms the state-of-art alignment methods in terms of conserved triangles. In addition, we show that the number of conserved triangles is more significantly correlated, compared to the conserved edge, with node correctness and co-expression of edges. Our formulation and resulting algorithms can be easily extended to arbitrary motifs.},

  ABSTRACT = {A knapsack problem is to select a set of items that maximizes the total profit of selected items while keeping the total weight of the selected items no less than the capacity of the knapsack. As a generalized form with multiple knapsacks, the multi-knapsack problem (MKP) is to select a disjointed set of items for each knapsack. To solve MKP, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach, which takes as input the available capacities of knapsacks, total profits and weights of selected items, and normalized profits and weights of unselected items and determines the next item to be mapped to the knapsack with the largest available capacity. To expedite the learning process, we adopt the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) for the policy model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the random and greedy methods and achieves comparable performance to an optimal policy in terms of the profit ratio of the selected items to the total profit sum, particularly when the profits and weights of items have a non-linear relationship such as quadratic forms.},
